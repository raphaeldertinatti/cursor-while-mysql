### About
Different of PLSQL, in MySQL you can use cursors only inside stored procedures. The structure of the statements are different too, here you must open the cursor and declare variables to FETCH the values retrieved. Instead of using the FOR LOOP statement like plsql, you must use WHILE...DO and you must declare one variable to exit the while loop process.
